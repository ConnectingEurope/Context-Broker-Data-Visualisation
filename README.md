The **Context Broker Data Visualization** is an **enabler** which consists on a **visualization layer** over the Context Broker, and also for historical data tools. It provides the following features:

- **Real-time data** visualization through geo-localized sensors in a map, based on the information from the **Orion Context Broker**.

- **Historical data** visualization for the sensors in table and graph format, taking profit of historical data tools as **Cygnus** and **STH-Comet**.

- Easy **Configuration page** for the integration with the Context Broker and the historical data tools.

- Integration with **more than one Context Broker at the same time**.

The Context Broker Data Visualization is a FIWARE Generic Enabler. Therefore, it can be integrated as part of any platform “Powered by FIWARE”. FIWARE is a curated framework of open source platform components which can be assembled together with other third-party platform components to accelerate the development of Smart Solutions.

## Objective

The Context Broker Data Visualization enabler was created with the aim of facilitate the **understanding of the data** the Context Broker can provide, and also to **ease the learning** about how to use it.

It is a **learning tool** for data visualization, not a product.

It could also be adapted to the necessities of every user by developing its own features, taking profit of the base of the enabler. More information can be found in the [documentation](#documentation) section.

## Documentation

The documentation of the Context Broker Data Visualization enabler is available in the following [link](doc/index.md)

## Deployment

There are four different tutorials for the deployment of the enabler, in a local environment or in [FIWARE lab](https://www.fiware.org/developers/fiware-lab/).

They can be found on the following [link](doc/tutorials/index.md).
